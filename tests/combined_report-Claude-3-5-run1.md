## Intermolecular Interactions and Solubilization in Redox Flow Battery Electrolytes

- **Overview:** This report explores the complex interplay of intermolecular forces affecting the solubilization of active materials in aqueous electrolytes for redox flow batteries.

- **Background:** The active material in question contains functional groups including carboxylate, sulfonate, aromatic rings, and ketone. These groups can participate in various intermolecular interactions with water and additives.

- **Summary of the data:** The analytical report reveals that solubilization is influenced by multiple chemical parameters, with hydrophobicity (measured by octanol-water partition coefficient) showing a positive correlation, while factors like hydroxyl group number, carbon group number, and various measures of molecular size and complexity generally decrease solubilization.

### Hypothesis 1: Hydrophobic Interactions Drive Solubilization Enhancement

The positive correlation between the octanol-water partition coefficient (logP) and solubilization (correlation ranging from 0.145 to 0.631 at different temperatures) suggests that hydrophobic interactions play a crucial role in enhancing the solubility of the active material.

This hypothesis is supported by the following evidence and reasoning:

1. The logP values show the strongest positive correlation with solubilization among all parameters studied, indicating that more hydrophobic additives are more effective at increasing solubility.

2. The negative correlation of carbon group number with solubilization (-0.146 to -0.685) initially seems contradictory. However, this can be explained by considering that while carbon groups increase hydrophobicity, they may also promote self-aggregation of additives, reducing their effectiveness in solubilizing the active material.

3. The presence of aromatic rings in the active material provides opportunities for hydrophobic interactions, particularly π-π stacking, with appropriate additives.

4. The molecular dynamics simulations mentioned in the supplementary research show that hydrophobic associations in aqueous salt solutions are strengthened by certain salts, correlating with experimental solubility data.

This hypothesis suggests that additives with balanced hydrophobicity could effectively interact with the aromatic and other hydrophobic portions of the active material, disrupting self-aggregation and promoting solubilization in the aqueous electrolyte. The key is to find additives that are hydrophobic enough to interact with the active material but not so hydrophobic that they self-aggregate or phase-separate from the aqueous solution.

### Hypothesis 2: Competitive Hydrogen Bonding Modulates Solubilization

The complex interplay of hydrogen bonding between water, the active material, and additives significantly influences solubilization, with competitive hydrogen bonding potentially explaining some of the observed trends.

This hypothesis is supported by the following evidence and reasoning:

1. The negative correlation between hydroxyl group number and solubilization (-0.234 to -0.644) suggests that additives with many hydroxyl groups may form extensive hydrogen bonds with water, creating a hydration shell that reduces interactions with the active material.

2. The weak positive to negative correlations of amino group number with solubilization (-0.144 to 0.102) indicate a complex role of these groups, possibly due to their ability to both donate and accept hydrogen bonds.

3. The negative correlation of Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA) with solubilization (-0.048 to -0.493) suggests that additives with large polar surface areas may engage in extensive hydrogen bonding with water, potentially leading to self-aggregation rather than interaction with the active material.

4. The carboxylate and sulfonate groups on the active material can participate in strong hydrogen bonding and ionic interactions. The slightly positive correlation of carboxylic group number in additives with solubilization (-0.024 to 0.029) suggests a potential for complementary interactions.

5. The supplementary research indicates that the extent of water-water hydrogen bonding in pure salt solutions correlates with experimental solubility data for hydrophobic solutes, suggesting that disruption of water structure plays a role in solubilization.

This hypothesis proposes that effective additives should have a balanced hydrogen bonding capacity. They should be able to compete with water-water hydrogen bonds and interact with the polar groups of the
